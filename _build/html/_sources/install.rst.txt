Installation
============

.. todo::

      * Install instructions need updating to the real install.
      * We need to make a hash for the downloadable version.
      * It would be great to have a test example that should be easy to launch and will run though everything that the script can do in the black box setting.

Due to the developmental and experimental nature of our scripts, we provide it as a set of run files instead of as an official package.
