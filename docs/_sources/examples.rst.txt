
Examples
========

Included in the KS-pies download is an example folder. In each folder is a run.py file which intends to showcase the use of a KS-pies feature.


.. _Full-example:

Testexample
###########

A complete example showing ZMP, WY and the util functions. A Be atom is used for the test density. Prints to terminal confirmation of working code.


.. _ZMP-benzene:

Benzene
#######

Use ZMP to create an potential of Benzene


.. _WY-regular:

Regularization
##############

Regularized WY on molecular nitrogen.


.. _userdefined-systems:

User_defined_system
###################

Regularized WY on a user defined harmonic oscillator.


.. _plot-xc:

Plot_xc
#######

Two examples including 1) regularized WY using the util functions with a PBE guiding potential and 2) regularized ZMP using the util functions with exchange-correlation aspects of the Fermi-Amaldi potential.
