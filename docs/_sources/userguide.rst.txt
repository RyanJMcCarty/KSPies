    * Need Summary
    * Need to refer to installation 
    * Need WY guide
    * Need ZMP guide
    * Need a slim example of both and the helper.
    * Probably should direct users to our upcoming paper for more scientific details.

Summary
    This is a broad outline on how the software is used. Both examples of WY and ZMP use the helper function. For a scientific discussion and examples on use, please refer to our paper on our software.

My vision for this is a script that is set up to work with pySCF, and goes from start to finish, making a molecules, running the pySCF parts, running the EY and ZMP with the helper function. Looking at the outputs.

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:

    from pyscf import gto, scf
    import zmp_dev as zmp

    mol = gto.M(atom='Ne',basis='aug-cc-pVQZ')
    mf = scf.RHF(mol).run()
    P_tar = mf.make_rdm1()

    mz = zmp.RZMP(mol,P_tar)
    mz.zscf(8)
